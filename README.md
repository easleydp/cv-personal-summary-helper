The CV Personal Summary Helper is a single-page web application designed to assist job seekers in selecting positive personal qualities for their CV's "Personal Summary" or "Profile" section. The application will present a comprehensive list of professional qualities that users can select and deselect, with their selections dynamically displayed in a separate panel. A "Copy to Clipboard" function will allow users to easily transfer their selected qualities to their CV editing software.

#### Target Users

- Job seekers with varying levels of IT literacy
- Will be used in a supervised **job club** environment with volunteer guidance
- Desktop/laptop users (no mobile optimization required)

#### Key Goals

- Provide a user-friendly, intuitive, accessible interface for quality selection
- Minimize cognitive load for users with low IT literacy
- Create a responsive design that maximizes visibility of available qualities
- Present a clean, professional appearance suitable for a job search context
- Allow users to copy the selected qualities to the clipboard as a comma-separated list.
- Load the list of qualities from an external JSON data file.
- Ensure basic accessibility and provide clear visual feedback.
